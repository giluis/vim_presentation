# Vim Presentation

Hello. If you don't have vim installed, do so through one of the following:
- WSL: Vim comes installed in most distros
- VsCodeVim: A VsCode extension that emulates Vim.
- GitBash: comes installed.

You can also use Vi/Vim through Powershell, although I don't recommend it.


# Setup
The setup is slightly different depending on the platform you're using Vim on.


## VsCode

Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/giluis/vim_presentation.git
```

Then open the cloned repo on VsCode and enable the VSCodeVim extension



## WSL

Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/giluis/vim_presentation.git
```

run `cd vim_presentation && cat .vimrc >> ~/.vimrc`



## GitBash

Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/giluis/vim_presentation.git
```

run `./gitbash.sh`
